# Lidar on Wheels

The Lidar on Wheels is a small experimental device we built in the [Virtual Humanities Lab](https://vhl.blogs.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/) at _Ruhr-University Bochum_ in 2023 and 2024.

The inner core of the robot is based on instructions by Gordon McComb, consisting of a small vehicle with two servomotors, an ultrasonic sensor for the detection of obstacles, and an Arduino microcontroller.
